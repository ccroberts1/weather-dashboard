# Weather Dashboard

## Overview

The goal for this project was to create a weather dashboard which could be used to get the current forecast and a 5-day outlook for a particular city. I used the Open Weather Map API and vanilla JavaScript for this and Bootstrap for the layout of the application.

Once the user searches for a city, it is added to localStorage and can be accessed with within a group of buttons which represent previous searches.
